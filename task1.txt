                            DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP 1.1 VS HTTP 2
          HTTP 1.1  
                It works on the textual format.
                There is head of line blocking that blocks all the request behind it until
                it doesnt get its all resources.
                It uses requests resources lining for use getting multiple pages.
                It compresses data by itself.
                Example:
                    Before sending the request the response there is the TCP
                    connection to establish between client and server for image (img.jpg)
                    and the server gives a response as an image.jpg the connection was not lost here
                    after the first request because we add a keep alive header which is the part
                    of the request so there is an open connection between the server and client .
                    there is a presistance connection between clinet and server that is merged
                    into a single connection.
        HTTP 2:
               IT works on the binary protocol
               It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is requried for multiple requests.
               It uses PUSH frame server that collects all multiple pages.
               IT uses HPACK for data compression.
               Eample:
                  All the drawbacks where made connected in HTTP2. it works on the binary
                  framing layer instead of textual that converts alll the message in binary format
                  it works on fully multplexed that is one  TCP COnnection is used for multiple requests.
